# EXBanka-4-Backend

## Project overview
Go-based microservices backend for EXBanka. Services communicate via gRPC. The API Gateway is the only HTTP-facing service.

## Go modules
- Multi-module workspace (`go.work` at repo root)
- One `go.mod` per service: `services/<name>/go.mod`
- Shared protobuf bindings: `shared/go.mod` → `github.com/RAF-SI-2025/EXBanka-4-Backend/shared`
- Service module paths: `github.com/RAF-SI-2025/EXBanka-4-Backend/services/<name>`
- Modules in `go.work`: `./services/account-service`, `./services/api-gateway`, `./services/auth-service`, `./services/card-service`, `./services/client-service`, `./services/email-service`, `./services/employee-service`, `./services/exchange-service`, `./services/loan-service`, `./services/order-service`, `./services/payment-service`, `./services/securities-service`, `./shared`

## Service layout conventions
```
services/<name>/
  db/                  # SQL schema (not all services have a DB)
  handlers/            # gRPC or HTTP handler implementations
  models/              # Data structs (where needed)
  queue/               # RabbitMQ producer/consumer (email-service only)
  templates/           # Email HTML templates (email-service only)
  docker-compose.yml   # PostgreSQL or RabbitMQ container
  main.go              # Entry point
```

## Shared Protobuf
- Source definitions: `shared/proto/*.proto` — one file per service: `account.proto`, `auth.proto`, `card.proto`, `client.proto`, `email.proto`, `employee.proto`, `exchange.proto`, `loan.proto`, `order.proto`, `payment.proto`, `securities.proto`
- Generated Go bindings (committed): `shared/pb/<service>/`
- After editing a `.proto` file, regenerate with:
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
protoc --go_out=shared/pb/<service> --go_opt=paths=source_relative \
       --go-grpc_out=shared/pb/<service> --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative \
       -I shared/proto shared/proto/<service>.proto
```
- The generated `*.pb.go` files have a `DO NOT EDIT` comment — always regenerate via protoc, never hand-edit them.

## Database
- Database-per-service: every DB-backed service has its own PostgreSQL via Docker Compose.
- Schema in `db/schema.sql`, auto-applied on first container startup via `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`.
- No `CREATE DATABASE` needed in SQL — handled by `POSTGRES_DB` env var.

## Environment variables
Service-to-service addresses (set by `dev.sh` or deployment):
- `EMPLOYEE_SERVICE_ADDR`, `AUTH_SERVICE_ADDR`, `CLIENT_SERVICE_ADDR`, `ACCOUNT_SERVICE_ADDR`
- `PAYMENT_SERVICE_ADDR`, `EXCHANGE_SERVICE_ADDR`, `LOAN_SERVICE_ADDR`, `CARD_SERVICE_ADDR`
- `SECURITIES_SERVICE_ADDR`, `ORDER_SERVICE_ADDR`, `EMAIL_SERVICE_ADDR`

Database URLs (one per service): `EMPLOYEE_DB_URL`, `AUTH_DB_URL`, `CLIENT_DB_URL`, `ACCOUNT_DB_URL`, `PAYMENT_DB_URL`, `EXCHANGE_DB_URL`, `LOAN_DB_URL`, `CARD_DB_URL`, `SECURITIES_DB_URL`, `ORDER_DB_URL`

A `.env` file at the repo root holds **email-service** variables:
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `FROM_EMAIL`, `RABBITMQ_URL`

`JWT_SECRET` is still hardcoded in `services/auth-service/handlers/grpc_server.go` and `services/api-gateway/middleware/auth.go` — move to env before production.

## Running the full stack
```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```
Starts all database containers (waits for readiness), RabbitMQ, then all 11 Go services. Ctrl+C stops the Go processes; containers keep running.

To reset all databases:
```bash
./scripts/reset-dbs.sh
```

To start only the infrastructure container for a service:
```bash
cd services/<service-name>
docker compose up -d
```

## Auth
- JWT signed with HMAC-SHA256. Access tokens expire in 15 min, refresh tokens in 7 days.
- `ADMIN` role bypasses all other role checks.
- New employees are created with `active=false` (DB column) / `Aktivan=false` (Go model field) and no password; they cannot log in until activated via `/auth/activate`.
